  Blockchain technology has emerged as a game-changer in the world of finance, revolutionizing traditional financial systems and opening up new possibilities for transparency, security, and efficiency. As a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain is transforming the way financial transactions are conducted, making processes more streamlined, cost-effective, and secure. In this article, we will explore how blockchain is reshaping the world of finance and the key benefits it offers.
  Enhanced Security: One of the primary advantages of blockchain technology is its enhanced security. Transactions recorded on a blockchain are encrypted, time-stamped, and linked to previous transactions, creating a tamper-proof and transparent record.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic that is transforming industries across the globe. Many believe that by 2030, there will be two types of companies: those that embrace AI and those that don’t. Our co-founder, Lucian Fogoros, recently had the opportunity to speak with Jürgen Weichenberger, the Head of AI at Schneider Electric, to gain insights into how AI is evolving within the industrial sector and the verticals that Schneider Electric covers.
n the industrial sector, there has been a clear shift from reactive and condition-based approaches to proactive control with the help of AI. Traditionally, companies would react to outcomes and try to improve their processes based on past data. However, this reactive approach often leads to lost value, wasted resources, and increased carbon emissions. AI plays a crucial role in changing this mindset from reactive to proactive by enabling real-time monitoring of factory operations and comparing them to the ideal state under given constraints.

    Almost everyone is familiar with artificial intelligence (AI) and applied blockchain. They are now considered as two of the hottest technology trends
     in the whole world because of their potential to disrupt industries. However, people still tend to think of artificial intelligence in terms of robots and blockchain in terms of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Artificial intelligence has more applications than just computing, while blockchain technology has so much potential for applications that could change the face of business. Even though the two technologies have very different developments and applications, researchers are now discovering that their combination actually works well in unison.
